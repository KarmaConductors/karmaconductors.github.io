<h2>Brandon 'Bubby' Jessee</h2>

<p>
From a young age Brandon excelled at baseball, basketball and boxing. Playing sports with his family and friends mostly every day. Smiling, joking and laughing. Crushing a baseball farther than most. (hell he was so slow rounding the bases that he had to hit it that hard!) He also had a love for music. Classic rock, alternative, country and yes at one point he loved rap!


After schooling Brandon moved onto softball and a career in construction. He had 2 beautiful daughter's, Isabel and Marissa, who he loves very much. If there was a family event going on, Brandon was there. Browns games every year with his cousins/brothers. Taking rides after games with his dad listening to game recaps and the debates that went with it. He enjoyed the time he spent with his kids. He also loved his sister's Ashley and Casey very much.


A tragic accident took Brandon from us too soon. His memory will live on with those that knew who bubby was. Love you brother.
